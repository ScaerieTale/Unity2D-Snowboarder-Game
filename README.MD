# CREDITS
Gamedev.tv obviously.  While I had programming experience going into this, my game design skills were all but non-existent, and my Unity experience even less than that.

Almost all assets are original to the Gamedev.tv project.  I've modified the snow boarder top, bottom, low poly snow tile, and created the two snow-bush PNGs from existing tree sprites, but they're under the same licensure as the original assets, so feel free to use them if you like them :-)
